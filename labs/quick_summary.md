# Lab​ ​1:​ ​Summary​ ​from​ ​Chapter​ ​1
  * Random​ ​sampling​ means
    * All individuals in the population have an equal chance of being included,
    * The sampling events are independent draws from the population
  * Most estimation methods and hypothesis tests assume that the data are a random sample from the population.
  * Biased​ ​sampling​ means some individuals are more likely than others to be selected.
  * Estimates​ are calculated from data. The goal of an estimator is to give values close to the true parameter​ ​value​.
  * Estimates are biased if there is a systematic tendency for them to be too high or too low.
  * Estimates are imprecise​ if they vary a lot when based on different samples.
  * We can detect measurement error by repeatedly measuring the same individual.
  * Measurement​ ​bias​ is a systematic difference between the true value and the measured value of each individual.
